# Bertram Labs Coding Challenge - David Hyun

## How to build and run project

Download project directory through git clone or downloading zip file, then in the project directory, run:

### `npm i`

To install dependencies required to run the application.\
Then run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Assumptions made 

Assuming that it is the same 5 people going to the coffee shop (Bob, Jeremy, and 5 other coworkers), I just randomly named the other 5 people as the following: John, Abby, Grace, David, Emily.\

Since the story says: "they walk down the street to their favorite coffee shop", I assumed that they go to the same coffee shop, so I just entered a static menu in the app. The user can simply press '+' next to each item in the menu to add to their order.\

## Entering data

Press '+' next to each item in the menu to add to ther order. Menu is the menu of the favorite coffee shop they go to. Prices are assumed prices of that coffee shop.
